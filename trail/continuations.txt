It sure would be nice to have a journal of the tomorrows, but
causality precluded that. Say, the girl-of-1989-or-1990 didn't show
up. Yes, there are 2 candidates, and they are both gone now. Gone
girls are my bane. I removed λ from my blist, just like Ι did many
others whose status are uninteresting to me.

Went to polygon, praticed the ignoring tenet. Kinda successful, the
only girl I get some details of is an orc-faced one in white, prolly
named Phương from the prolly-hers tooth that H tried to remind me
of. So that made it 2 girls maximum.

Canoc goaded me for some dota, and I also wanted to fight some pubs,
but can't work up the courage to do it. Porn and news are always in
shorter reach.
