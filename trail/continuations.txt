It sure would be nice to have a journal of the tomorrows, but
causality precluded that. Say, the girl-of-1989-or-1990 didn't show
up. Yes, there are 2 candidates, and they are both gone now. Gone
girls are my bane. I removed λ from my blist, just like Ι did many
others whose status are uninteresting to me.

Went to polygon, praticed the ignoring tenet. Kinda successful, the
only girl I get some details of is an orc-faced one in white, prolly
named Phương from the prolly-hers tooth that H tried to remind me
of. So that made it 2 girls maximum.

Canoc goaded me for some dota, and I also wanted to fight some pubs,
but can't work up the courage to do it. Porn and news are always in
shorter reach.

Name every journal-updating commit "journal". Its purpose is
to keep the rambling going with transparent timestamps, not being a
checkpointed work of art. Gotta ask mom if the therapist said anything
about keeping a diary.

This journal goi jy is a replacement for the imaginary conversations I had
with people in my head goi ibu. ibu have the voice I have heard of
them, but only make simple responses, if any. These imaginations are
the reason I distrust my memories.

Mom said the therapist didn't mention keeping a diary.

So exhausted I'm not sure I can keep up with a job at kloon.

exc prodded about a job with lqthai. Didn't remember that I worked
under him for 1 week.

Drained some tequila+salt+lime from dk's first pay. Came home to exc's
link of long's startup. "Kinda like SO" "Requiring JS is below SO".

 The world is pretty small. Try looking into some non-comp fields.

Jo asked about a trip to some resort in KH, in summer. Prolly after
Aug. Securing some tickets shouldn't be difficult.

Gonna resend the kloon letter now.
