Hi, thanks for looking into contributing. These are some features that luser is missing:

* TODO Handle gzip responses (news.zing.vn and baomoi.com)
  These sites always return gzip-encoded HTML, even when
  Accept-Encoding doesn't list it. You can check by comparing =curl=
  vs =curl --compressed=.
* TODO Configurable multiple channels support
  Possibly as commandline arguments, can also set owners.
* TODO Reading secrets from files
  API keys, identify passwords, channel passwords.
* TODO Tests
  It would be difficult to interface with IRC servers, but at least
  the handling functions should be tested.
* TODO CLI interface
  Like chatbot's, this will speed up testing.
* TODO NYtimes access
  The cookie needs to be rebaked. Theoretically cloaking as googlebot should work.
* TODO Pod titles in rust
  Quick-xml doesn't return the attributes iterator currently.
* TODO Reconnection on ping timeout

  tunneling is interfering
