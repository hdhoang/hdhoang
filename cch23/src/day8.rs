//! üéÑ Day 8: Pok√©Physics

//! In the heart of the North Pole, Santa's workshop buzzes with a new
//! type of magic. A portal has opened, and Pok√©mon from another world
//! have tumbled into the snow-dusted realm of elves and
//! reindeer. Santa, ever the innovator, sees an opportunity: why not
//! enlist these charming creatures in his annual gift-giving
//! campaign?

//! But before the sleigh bells ring and the Pok√©mon can join the
//! flight, Santa needs to understand their unique properties and
//! figure out how many can fit into his sleigh, given their weight.
